# Competition Summary

## Description

This challenge was designed specifically for the Hack For Earth 2019, which took place on 30th of November, 2019 in Tunisia.

The objective of this competition was to create a machine learning model to help Kenyan non-profit organization Local Ocean Conservation anticipate the number of turtles they will rescue from each of their rescue sites as part of their By-Catch Release Programme.

## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).

## Datasets and packages

The data used to train the model was an historic data on the number of turtles rescued from each site from 1998 until 2018.

Only the datasets provided for this competition was used.

The data was provided by Local Ocean Conservation that has released over 10,000 sea turtles.

## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.

## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)

## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.

## Evaluation:

The Root Mean Squared Error was used to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions. 

## Prizes
1st prize: 500 DNT

2nd prize: 300 DNT

3rd prize: 200 DNT

To encourage women participation the hackathon has secured a prize for the woman with the best score at the end of the hackathon.

## Benefits
An accurate prediction will enable Local Ocean Conservation to allocate staff and resources more efficiently. 

As an actual environmental challenge, it aims to establish solutions for the common good and also to strengthen the AI community in Tunisia.
