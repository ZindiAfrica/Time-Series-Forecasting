# Competition Summary

## Description

In the face of climate change, the agricultural sector in Africa needs to adapt its practices.

Being able to accurately measure and predict soil humidity in their fields will allow farmers to prepare their irrigation schedules optimally and efficiently.

Sensor-based irrigation and machine learning algorithms can provide farmers with a solution to manage water usage more efficiently.

Stable sensor data is difficult to obtain in rural Africa where many problems arise such as accessibility, limited battery power, lack of internet, humidity/heat problem.

The objective of this Zindi competition is to create a machine learning model capable of predicting the humidity for a particular plot in the next few days, using data from the past.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

Only the datasets provided for this competition was used.

This dataset was collected as part of an experiment conducted by Wazihub using low-cost internet of things (IoT) sensors over 4 months in 4 fields growing maize and peanuts in Senegal.

An IoT sensor was placed in four distinct plots of land that were planted with either maize or peanuts (the same amount of maize is sown in each maize plot, and the same for peanuts). 

Plots are right next to each other, separated by a one meter perimeter.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The Root Mean Squared Error was used to evaluate accuracy of the submitted solutions.

## Prizes

1st Prize: $2 000 USD + 1 Gateway + 3 IoT Kits (worth approximately $1 500 USD)

2nd Prize: $1 250 USD + 1 Gateway + 2 IoT Kits (worth approximately $1 00 USD)

3rd Prize: $750 USD + 1 Gateway + 1 IoT Kits (worth approximately $500 USD each)

4th to 5th Prize: 1 Gateway + 1 IoT Kits (worth approximately $500 USD each)



## Benefits

This solution will help farmers prepare their irrigation schedules more efficiently.
