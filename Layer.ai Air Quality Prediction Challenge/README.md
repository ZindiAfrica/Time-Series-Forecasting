# Competition Summary

## Description

AirQo’s air quality sensing network has more than 120 low-cost devices deployed across Uganda, which regulalry sense and report on air quality using the PM2.5 measure.

In this challenge we explore using satellite radar data from Sentinel 5P to predict air quality in regions in Kampala. The use of satellite data could expand air quality predictions to areas without air quality sensor devices.

The objective of this challenge is to predict air quality readings from AirQo’s sensors using Sentinel 5P data.

Participants in this challenge are encouraged to use Layer.ai to track their experiments. Code submissions need to be supported by a Layer repo and report. You can learn more about using Layer for machine learning, and sign up for Layer.ai


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

This data has been collected from five sensors stationed across Uganda. Readings are taken every hour.

The training data consists of 15,000 sets of 5 days of hourly weather data readings plus one air quality reading exactly 24 hours after the last weather reading.

The test set consists of a different 5,000 sets of 5-day hourly weather data readings.

The date or time for any of the data was not given.

## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.

## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)

## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.

## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this challenge is Mean Absolute Error.
