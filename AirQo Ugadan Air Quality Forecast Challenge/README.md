# Competition Summary

## Description

AirQo has built a low-cost network of sensors and collected data across 65 locations in Uganda with some sites monitoring for over three years.

There is now a wealth of data which can be used to achieve impact in this critical area.

The increase in availability of air quality data allows us to analyse historical and up to the minute results to gain insights into trends, hotspots, causes and consequences of poor air, potential policy solutions and so much more.

The objective of this challenge is to accurately forecast air quality (as measured by PM2.5 Âµ/m3) for each hour of the coming 25 hours across five locations in Kampala Uganda.

Forecasts was based on the past 5 days of hourly air quality measurements at each site.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

This data has been collected from five sensors stationed across Uganda. Readings are taken every hour.

The training data consists of 15,000 sets of 5 days of hourly weather data readings plus one air quality reading exactly 24 hours after the last weather reading.

The test set consists of a different 5,000 sets of 5-day hourly weather data readings.

The date or time for any of the data was not given.

## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.

## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)

## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.

## Evaluation:

The Root Mean Squared Error was used to evaluate accuracy of the submitted solutions.

## Prizes

1st Place: $1 250 USD

2nd Place: $750 USD

3rd Place: $500 USD

Implementation: $2 500 USD



## Benefits

These forecasts will be helpful to inform public awareness and be built into safety alerts.

The ability to accurately predict what air quality will be in the coming days is essential for empowering everyone from governments to families to make informed decisions to protect health and guide action, just as we do with weather.

Activities that are known to contribute to poor air quality such as high traffic volumes, rubbish burning, cooking using charcoal and firewood, even construction or other government works can also be reconsidered depending on the forecast.

If it is known that the next day will be a high pollution day then sports or other events may need to be rescheduled or relocated.
