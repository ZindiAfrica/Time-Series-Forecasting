# Competition Summary

## Description

On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially classified COVID-19 as a pandemic. At the time, the number of confirmed cases were over 130,000 across 114 countries around the world, with the number of deaths caused by the disease over 5,000.

Accurately modelling the spread of these viral diseases is critical for policymakers and health workers to take appropriate actions to contain and mitigate the impact of these disease.

This challenge asks data scientists on Zindi to accurately predict the spread of COVID-19 around the world over the next few months.

Solutions will be evaluated against future data.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The solutions used publicly-available, open-source packages only.  

Models did not use any of the metadata provided.

 The publicly-available data from the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) was used.
 
 Other publicly-available datasets to use in models was permitted after approval.
## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.

## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)

## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.

## Evaluation:

The Mean Absolute Error was used to evaluate accuracy of the submitted solutions.

## Prizes

1st: $2 500 USD

2nd: $1 500 USD

3rd: $1 000 USD



## Benefits

Accurately modelling the spread of these viral diseases is critical for policymakers and health workers to take appropriate actions to contain and mitigate the impact of these disease.

This challenge could help contribute to the global body of knowledge which will help stem the impact of pandemics such as this one as well as those in the future.
